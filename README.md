Kinematic Equations Helper: Interactive Physics Formula Guide
The Kinematic Equations Helper is an interactive web application designed to assist physics students in selecting the appropriate kinematic formula for solving motion problems. When studying kinematics, students often struggle to determine which equation to use based on the variables they know and the variable they need to find.
This intuitive application simplifies the decision-making process by:

Allowing students to check boxes for the variables they know (initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, time, and displacement)
Instantly displaying the correct formula to use based on the standard kinematic equations:

Formula 1: a = (vf - vᵢ) / t - When displacement is not given or required
Formula 2: Δx = ((vᵢ + vf) / 2) · t - When acceleration is not given or required
Formula 3: Δx = ½at² + vᵢt - When final velocity is not given or required
Formula 4: vf² = vᵢ² + 2aΔx - When time is not given or required


Providing clear guidance on when to use each formula, following standard physics education principles

The application features a clean, intuitive interface with responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices. A helpful reference section displays all four kinematic equations with their usage rules for quick reference.
Perfect for physics students at high school and introductory college levels, this tool serves as an excellent supplementary resource alongside traditional physics education. Teachers can use it as a classroom aid to help students develop independence in problem-solving skills and build confidence in applying the correct formula to various kinematic scenarios.
